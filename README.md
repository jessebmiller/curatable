# Curatable

System for getting a Luke Haynes quilt (or any valuable artwork) curated

# Theory

Artwork creates value when exhibited.
Promoters work to find proffitible oportunities for exhibition
The Handler/Owner maintains posession of the artowrk and is paid to exhibit the work
Shareholders in the artwork are paid to exhibit the work

* The artwork needs a handler who will deliver the artwork to the museum when curated
* The handler will also store the artwork safely
* Promoters may propose an exhibition of the work
  * Stake amounts for the promoter and handler
  * The details of exhibition (where, when, contact info, etc.)
  * Fee amount that the promoter is committing to securing
* The handler may accept the proposal and commit to present (after confirming with the gallery)
* Both parties stake the agreed to amount
* Once the fee is paid, the stakes are returned and the fee is split proportionally
